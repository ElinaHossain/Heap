# Heap

## Overview
This Java program implements a generic heap data structure, demonstrating its functionality with examples of insertion, deletion, heapification, and sorting. The program utilizes a max heap, where the key of each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children. The heap is generic and can be used to store items with any comparable key-value pairs.

## What Does the Program Do?
- The program showcases the implementation of a max heap with the following key features:
- Insertion: Allows insertion of key-value pairs into the heap, maintaining the max heap property.
- Deletion (Delete Root): Removes and returns the root (maximum) element from the heap, adjusting the heap to maintain the max heap property.
- Heapify: Converts an array of key-value pairs into a valid max heap using the heapify operation.
- Heap Sorting: Sorts the elements in the heap using the heap sort algorithm.
- Print: Prints the key-value pairs of the heap.

## What I Learned:
- Implementation of a generic max heap in Java.
- Operations such as insertion, deletion, heapify, and heap sort in the context of a heap.
- Techniques for fixing up and fixing down elements to maintain the max heap property.
- Utilization of generics to create a flexible and reusable heap data structure.

## How Could I Improve It?
- Exception Handling: Implement proper exception handling for edge cases, such as attempting to delete from an empty heap or inserting null keys or values.
- Optimization: Evaluate and optimize the efficiency of the fixDown and fixUp methods for better performance.
- Documentation: Enhance code comments to explain complex logic or algorithms, providing clarity for future developers or contributors.
- Generic Type Bounds: Restrict the generic types to extend Comparable to ensure that the keys can be compared.
- Additional Heap Operations: Expand the heap functionality by implementing additional operations such as updating a key's value or finding the minimum element in a min heap.
